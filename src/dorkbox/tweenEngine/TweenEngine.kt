/**
 * The TweenEngine is responsible for creating Tweens and Timelines, and can be either managed, or un-managed.
 *
 * If managed, [TweenEngine.update] will update all your tweens and timelines at once, as well as managing the tween/timeline
 * life-cycles for you and releasing pooled objects.
 *
 * If un-managed, then you must update the tween/timeline manually, and make sure to release the tween objects back to the pool manually via
 * [BaseTween.free]
 *
 * Just give it a bunch of tweens or timelines and call [update] periodically, you don't need to do anything else!
 *
 * More fine-grained control is available as well via [update] to update via seconds (1.0F == 1.0 seconds), or
 * [update] to update via nano-seconds.
