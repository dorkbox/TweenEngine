/**
 * ## Core class of the Tween Engine.
 *
 * A Tween is basically an interpolation between two values of an object attribute. However, the main
 * interest of a Tween is that you can apply an easing formula on this interpolation, in order to smooth the transitions or to achieve
 * cool effects like springs or bounces.
 *
 * The Tween Engine is also "universal" because it is able to apply interpolations on every attribute from every possible object. Therefore,
 * every object in your application can be animated with cool effects: it does not matter if your application is a game, a desktop
 * interface or even a console program! If it makes sense to animate something, then it can be animated through this engine.
 *
 * This class contains many static factory methods to create and instantiate new interpolations easily. The common way to create a Tween is
 * by using one of these factories:
 *
 *
 * - TweenEngine.to(...)
 *
 * - TweenEngine.from(...)
 *
 * - TweenEngine.set(...)
 *
 * - TweenEngine.call(...)
 *
 *
 * ## Example - firing a Tween
 *
 * The following example will move the target horizontal position from its current value to x=200 and y=300, during 500ms, but only after
 * a delay of 1000ms. The animation will also be repeated 2 times (the starting position is registered at the end of the delay, so the
 * animation will automatically restart from this registered position).
 *
 * ```
 * private val engine = TweenEngine.create()
 *            .setWaypointsLimit(10)
 *            .setCombinedAttributesLimit(2)
 *            .registerAccessor(XYZ::class.java, ABC())
 *            .build()
 *
 * engine.to(myObject, POSITION_XY, 500)
 *      .value(200, 300)
 *      .ease(Quad_InOut)
 *      .delay(1.0F)
 *      .repeat(2, 0.02F)
 *      .start();
 *```
 *
 * Tween life-cycles can be automatically managed for you, thanks to the [TweenEngine] class. If you choose to manage your tween
 * when you start it, then you don't need to care about it anymore. **Tweens are *fire-and-forget*: don't think about them anymore
 * once you started them (if they are managed of course).**
 *
 * You need to periodically update the tween engine, in order to compute the new values. If your tweens are managed, only update the
 * manager; else you need to call [Tween.updateUnsafe] on your tweens periodically.
 *
 * ## Example - setting up the engine
 *
 * The engine cannot directly change your objects attributes, since it doesn't know them. Therefore, you need to tell him how to get and
 * set the different attributes of your objects: **you need to implement the [TweenAccessor] interface for each object class you
 * will animate**. Once done, don't forget to register these implementations, using the static method
 * [EngineBuilder.registerAccessor], when you start your application.
