/**
 * A Timeline can be used to create complex animations made of sequences and parallel sets of Tweens.
 *
 * The following example will create an animation sequence composed of 5 parts:
 *
 * 1. First, opacity and scale are set to 0 (with Tween.set() calls).
 * 2. Then, opacity and scale are animated in parallel.
 * 3. Then, the animation is paused for 1s.
 * 4. Then, position is animated to x=100.
 * 5. Then, rotation is animated to 360Â°.
 *
 * This animation will be repeated 5 times, with a 500ms delay between each
 * iteration:
 *
 * ```
